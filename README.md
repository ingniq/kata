# kata tasks
### An example of the implementation of two tasks

1. [OddWord](odd_word).

    Find a string of a given length such that each letter occurs an odd number of times.
2. [DistinctLettersCount](distinct_letters_count).
    
    Count the minimum number of letters that must be deleted from a word to create a word in which no two letters occur the same number of times.
